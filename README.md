# Mahi-App CmdLine
CmdLine is part of a series of articles that illustrate a variety of programming concepts based on .NET Core.

# Disclaimer
The implementation of Mahi-App is highly opinionated. This means that what you find works but is most certainly not the only way to implement this application. If you found alternative ways that work for you, that's awesome!

Either way, here the intention is to share solutions, i.e. designs and implementations, that you may find helpful as well.
